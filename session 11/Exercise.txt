Student Grade Calculator with Exception Handling

Write a Java program to manage a student’s exam scores and calculate the average, including input validation with exception handling.

Instructions:

Create a class named Student with these private fields:
name (String)
exam1 (int)
exam2 (int)
exam3 (int)
Create a constructor that accepts the student’s name and three exam scores, initializing the fields.
Implement input validation in the constructor or setters to ensure that exam scores are between 0 and 100. If an invalid score is passed, throw an IllegalArgumentException with the message "Exam scores must be between 0 and 100."
Create getter methods for each field.
Create a method named calculateAverage() that returns the average of the three exam scores as a double.
In the main method:
Use try-catch to create a Student object for a student named "John" with exam scores 75, 110, and 90. (Notice 110 is invalid.)
If an exception is caught, print the exception message.
If creation succeeds, print the student’s name and average exam score (formatted to two decimal places).
